# emacs.d
This is personal Emacs config. All packages are managed by cask using the gnu and melpa repository. If you would like to use this config, you just install cask (in mac os, `brew install cask`) and hit `cask` in this directory. I use evil.el and some relevant plugin, so it's easy to use for vim user.
